Installation
------------
Copy the folder dpwpsimplecache and its content into 

	your-blog/wp-content/plugins

Usage
-----
dpwpsimplecache provides a global variable $dpcache, which is an instantiation of the class DP_Cache already set up to talk to the $_SESSION. Always use the global $dpcache variable (Remember to globalize $dpcache before using it in any custom functions). 

If you don't want to track sessions into db set the $USE_DB_SESSION_MANAGER global variable to 0

	global $USE_DB_SESSION_MANAGER;
	$USE_DB_SESSION_MANAGER = 0; // default 1

Insert object;

	$dpcache->set($key,$object);
	
Get object:

	$object = $dpcache->set($key);
	
Count active users:

	$count_users = $dpcache->get_sessions_number();
	
Count objects in the current user's $_SESSION:

	$dpcache->get_statistics();
	
Get all objects the current user's $_SESSION:

	$dpcache->get_all_values();
	
Test if an object exist the current user's $_SESSION:

	$dpcache->contais($key);
	
Delete all objects. If the $all parameter is set to false the method delete only the current user's $_SESSION, if true truncate the entire table (default false):

	$dpcache->flush($all);
	
Prints human-readable information about all objects:

	$dpcache->inspect();
	
Delete an object the current user's $_SESSION:

	$dpcache->delete($key);
	
At any time, through the administrative page, you can:

* see all objects in the current user cache
* delete all objects in the current user cache
* forcing deletion of all sessions
